Hey developer,

We have seen that your password is too weak and has been leaked in serveral data breaches.
Your username (developer) also is so common to guess, as a punishment for not following organisation norms.
We have decided to remove your sudoers permission on the CTF Servers but still you have the permissions for the dev environments to run and test the Web Applications.
We look forward for you to adhere to organisations password policies, until you remain blacklisted from sudoers.

Happy Hacking,
Team Lead @ CTF Servers.
